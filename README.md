# vimrc

I use this as a place to put my vimrc so I can easily download it whenever I reinstall linux so I don't have to rewrite it every time.

# How to use this to your advantage

If possible, you can put your vimrcs with a filename ".vimrc" in a folder with named with something you can identify, it would be best to choose something others will not choose, it is best to choose your full name or username than "cat" or "dog" as those are likely to be chosen by others.
